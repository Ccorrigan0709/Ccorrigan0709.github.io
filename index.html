            <h2>Conclusions and Reflections/Learning</h2>
            <p>
                The outcome of this project was a success. We successfully developed WanderSync, a travel-management app that helps users organize trips and vacations. The app includes a robust system for managing accommodations, destinations, and dining reservations, as well as a community-driven travel database. We utilized Firebase for real-time data synchronization and user-specific storage. Additionally, we implemented a bottom navigation system to ensure smooth transitions between core activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                One significant challenge we faced was implementing real-time data synchronization with Firebase. Midway through the project, we discovered issues in our Firebase setup that caused unexpected problems. Resolving these issues was challenging, as the in-class resources were insufficient, requiring us to rely on external materials like Firebase documentation. For example, we learned to use the .child method to store data across different databases. Another hurdle was implementing proper getters and setters to handle objects in Firebase effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also encountered difficulties in delegating work among teammates. Despite establishing pre-sprint agreements, some tasks took longer than expected, leading to scheduling conflicts and delays. At times, task dependencies created bottlenecks, where one team member's work needed to be completed before another could proceed. These moments of overlap and misalignment required flexibility and frequent communication to resolve.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite these challenges, developing WanderSync provided us with valuable insights into software design and architectural patterns, such as MVVM, SOLID principles, and GRASP. The MVVM structure allowed us to separate application logic into the Model, View, and ViewModel, resulting in clean, maintainable code. SOLID principles guided us in creating a modular and extensible codebase, emphasizing single responsibility and dependency inversion. GRASP principles, like low coupling and high cohesion, informed our responsibility assignments. Applying these patterns not only helped us deliver a well-structured and reliable application but also strengthened our ability to approach future projects with a professional mindset.
